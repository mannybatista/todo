This is my fun tutorial..

Ok, now try to do this:

Checkout/clone the depot.
Switch to the 'git-tutorial' branch.
Edit this file - put something below.
Add it to git.
Commit it to git 'locally'
Push it to git.
And create a 'pull request' - that's on the github.com webpage.


---- This is my edit from the screenshot!
